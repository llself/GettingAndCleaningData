This provides a CodeBook for the run_Analysis.R script.  For details on the steps I performed and my reason for performing them, please see the README.md file in the github repository.  

WearableComputingTidyDS - dataset that represents subject data for wearable computing.  This is a tidy dataset that captures all variables.
  679,734 rows, 4 columns
    1. Activity - factor variable with 6 values representing the type of activity user is performing while wearing a wearable computing device:
         Values:
          LAYING
          SITTING
          STANDING
          WALKING
          WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
          WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    2. SubjectID - integer variable with 30 values, each integer representing a person that took part in the study.
        Values:
          1
          2
          3
          4
          5
          6
          ...
          28
          29
          30
    3. Domain - character variable representing whether the individual is capturing time or frequency of activity being performed:
        Values:
          Time
          Frequency  
    4. Signal Type - character variable representing type of motion/work captured during activity. 
        Values:
          BodyAcc
          BodyAccJerk
          BodyAccJerkMag
          BodyAccMag
          BodyBOdyGyroJerkMag
          BodyBodyGyroMag
          BodyGyro
          BodyGyroJerk
          BodyGyroJerkMag
          BodyGyroMag
          GravityAcc          
          GravityAccMag
    5.  Calculation - character variable representating type of calculation on measure
          Values:
            Mean - mean
            std - standard deviation
    6.  value - this is the measure being calculated for the subject doing this activity in this domain and single type
